# LLD Workshop - NIPS 2017 (Unofficial Workshop Book)

**Learning with Limited Labeled Data: Weak Supervision and Beyond**. Really cool workshop and set of papers. The book basically is aimed at people who wish to read all the papers without the fuzz of downloading them one by one. There were few papers whose pdf weren't available as listed below.

Contents taken from the official workshop website - https://lld-workshop.github.io/

## Contents of the Repo

- `script.py` - script to extract papers whose PDF is available and join them into a book and save it. :)
- `lld_nips17_workshop_book.pdf` - the workshop book combining the accepted papers.

**If this was useful, you can modify the script to generate similarly for other sites (depends). I have done it on 2 other workshops which I was interested in reading end2end**
